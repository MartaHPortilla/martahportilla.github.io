## BatukAfina

**BatukAfina** is a **native Android percussion tuning app** built to help musicians achieve accurate and consistent tuning in an intuitive way. Designed for **drummers, percussionists, and music students**, it transforms a traditionally manual process into a **clear, guided digital experience**.

Tuning percussion instruments often relies on ear training and experience. BatukAfina complements that skill by providing **real-time audio analysis and visual feedback**, helping users understand pitch, tension, and balance across their instruments.

### Key Features

- Tune individual drums or full percussion setups  
- Visual indicators for pitch and tension adjustments  
- Save and recall custom tuning presets  
- Lightweight, responsive, and distraction-free interface  

### Technical Approach

BatukAfina emphasizes:

- **Native Android development** using Kotlin and Java  
- Clean architecture with modern patterns (**MVVM, Jetpack**)  
- Offline-first behavior and lightweight performance  
- UX tailored to musicians, not engineers  

BatukAfina bridges the gap between **musical intuition and digital precision**, making it ideal for beginners and professionals alike.
