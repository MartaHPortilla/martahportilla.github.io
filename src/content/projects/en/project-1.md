**Metronopy** is an open-source **Python tool** that lets you create **custom audiovisual metronomes**, combining **precise audio beats** with **synchronized visual cues**. It's designed for **musicians, educators, and developers** who want a reliable, reusable metronome for practice, teaching, or multimedia projects.

Unlike traditional metronomes, Metronopy produces a **deterministic video output**, ensuring every beat and visual marker is perfectly aligned—ideal for **high-quality rhythm references and instructional content**.

## Features of Metronopy

- Generate **metronome sequences as video files**  
- Control **tempo, time signature, and total duration**  
- Deterministic output ensures **reproducibility and accuracy**  
- Clear separation between **core logic and infrastructure**  

## Why Metronopy Stands Out

Metronopy was built with **software engineering best practices**:

- Clean and **explicit domain logic**  
- Modular design for easy **maintenance and extension**  
- Well-documented code for **developers of all levels**  
- Deterministic behavior, perfect for **testing and learning**  

This project is a **hands-on exploration** of Python multimedia programming, focusing on **video generation, sound synchronization, and maintainable architecture** rather than heavy frameworks.

## Who Can Benefit

- **Musicians** looking for precise rhythm references  
- **Music educators** creating instructional videos  
- **Developers** exploring Python multimedia projects  

Metronopy sits at the intersection of **music, technology, and education**, making it a nice tool for combining **software development with musical creativity**.
