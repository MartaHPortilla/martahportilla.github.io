#### Hi, I'm Marta 👋

I am a software developer with a background in journalism and creative writing, currently focused on multiplatform application development.

I mainly work with Kotlin, Java, Python and Android technologies, building clean, structured and maintainable applications.

My experience combines native Android development, object-oriented programming and modern architectural patterns such as MVVM. I’m especially interested in well-documented code, clear requirements and projects where software design and problem-solving really matter.

I’m currently open to learning opportunities and internships, where I can grow as a developer while contributing to real, impactful projects in collaborative and international environments.
